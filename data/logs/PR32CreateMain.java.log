At one moment they had to go through something to get to this one place (sorry I can't recall what it was.) When they went through there they fell in a Genjutsu without knowing. In that Genjutsu Naruto is seeing a flashback of Hinata and him, but mostly Hinata. Naruto starts seeing some moments where Hinata as a kid wrote his name on a piece of paper and started to get happy, then after he fought Kiba she gave Naruto that healing cream, when he was on the ground when he was fighting Pain she protected him and confessed her love for him, Hinata talking to Sakura about Naruto, etc. After seeing all that, Sakura is able to break the Genjutsu on him and he is able to wake up. After that, they continue to look for Hinata's sister. Hinata and Naruto have to share one of Sai's painted birds to fly on. Naruto starts to look at Hinata different. Is it because he feels sorry for being oblivious of her love for him? Then after feeling sorry, did he start feeling something for her as well or what because after that guy (sorry I forgot his name) took Hinata with him, Naruto tried to get her back. He ended up losing and getting so hurt he kinda fell in a comma. After he woke up Sai and Shikamaru told him that Sakura was all awake day and night trying to bring him back and that he was saying Hinata's name over and over. He went to see Sakura because Shikamaru and Sai said she was really bad. When he was with her she said, \"So you finally noticed\", or something like that. Then at the end of the movie, he takes Hinata and starts blasting his Rasengan like that they can move faster. They end up really high in the sky, then he kisses her. When the credits are on we see that they got married, then after that, there is a short scene that shows her knitting a scarf and his training outside in the snow. A couple of seconds later their two kids are shown, then they all start a snow fight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So my question is if Naruto did quickly fall in love with Hinata after the Genjutsu in the movie, or did he slowly start to feel something for her after it?</p>\n\n<p>Also, in between that blank timeline of those two years, did Naruto figure out that Sakura was never going to fall in love with him and stopped liking her or did he stop liking her after being in that Genjutsu?</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "20270", "LastActivityDate": "2018-07-10T04:53:33.723", "Title": "Did Naruto REALLY fall in love with Hinata in The Last: Naruto the Movie?", "Tags": "<naruto>", "AnswerCount": "8", "CommentCount": "1", "ContentLicense": "CC BY-SA 3.0"}
